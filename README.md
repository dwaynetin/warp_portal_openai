# warp_portal_openai

This is a node command line executable that uses ChatGPT API to creates a website and auto-deploys it to your own github page, rather than having to manually do it on your own.

You type:
node index.js "Library website"

It gives you the URL where your website is deployed.
<owner>.github.io/<uniqueURL>


You ask Chat GPT to create a website.
To deploy it publicly, you have to:
1. copy paste the code generated by the ChatGPT console.
2. find a website host provider - for example, Github Pages.
3. create a repo.
4. create a branch called gh-pages
5. commit.

Takes around 30 minutes to an hour to do right.
Too lazy to do it?

Why not try this node JS command line where you just need to type what website you want to create...

like...

node index.js "eCommerce website"

Just supply the Github Personal Access Token Key and Chat GPT Key in ENV.

it will give you the URL after - within 10 seconds.
